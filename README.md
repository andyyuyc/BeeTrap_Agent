## How It Works

1. Unity sends game state data via **socket (TCP, port 5005)**.
2. `BeeTrapReceiver` receives and saves each JSON object to `data_logs/`.
3. `BeeTrapAgent` scans that folder, analyzes unprocessed files, and sends them to GPT via OpenAI API.
4. Each file is moved to `processed_logs/` after analysis.
5. Only hints (if applicable) are printed to the terminal.
